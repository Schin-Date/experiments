                   Definition of times and epochs

  For the units to count time intervals, there are physical time like TAI
and terrestial times like UA1 and GMST. The physical time defines a second
by means of a well defined physics phenomena like atomic decay life time
at the rest frame of atoms. The terrestial times are defined as angles
of the earth rotation around its axis with respect to different terrestial
objects, e.g. the Sun and stars. 

The earth rotations
  The earth is revolving around the Sun. This defines the ¡Úecliptic (²«Æ»)¡Û
circle around the earth. The ecliptic circle is a circle centered at
the center of the earth and is on the plane of the revolution.
  The earth is rotating around its axis. The axis defines the direction north.
The polar angle of the axis with respect to the normal direction to the
revolution plane is called ¡Úobliquity of the ecliptic (²«Æ»Ê¿¶Ñ·¹¼Ð³Ñ)¡Û and
given by ¦Å= 23¡ë26' 21''.488.  A plane parpendicular to the earth rotation
axis defines the ¡Úcelestial equator()¡Û. The angle between the celestial
equator and the ecliptic is the obliquity of the ecliptic.
  The direction of the revolution and the rotation are the same in a sense
that vectors of the revolution and rotation axes direct into the same
hemisphare.
  One of two points where the ecliptic and the celestial equator crosses  
is the ¡Úvernal equinox(½ÕÊ¬ÅÀ)¡Û. A line from the Sun to the earth goes 
through this point on the equinox.
