\section{Time System}

\subsection{Facts}
\begin{itemize}
\item The standard astronomical epoch $=$ J2000.0 $=$
JD2451545.0 $=$ 2000 January 1, $12^h$ TT.
\item The unit of time in the international system of units, the SI second, 
is defined as the fundamental unit of TAI.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Explanation}

  For the units to count time intervals, there are physical time like TAI
and terrestial times like UA1 and GMST. The physical time defines a second
by means of a well defined physics phenomena like atomic decay life time
at the rest frame of atoms. The terrestial times are defined as angles
of the earth rotation around its axis with respect to different terrestial
objects, e.g. the Sun and stars. Descriptions here are based on Ref.
\cite{ref:almanac}

\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf Atomic and Dynamical times} 
\begin{itemize}
\item TAI (International Atomic Time) defines the unit SI second.
\item TDT (Terrestial Dynamical Time) is the time passing at the 
center of gravity of the earth. Renamed to TT (Terrestial Time) in
1991.
\item TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) is the time passing at the
center of gravity of the slolar system.
\end{itemize}

One second in TAI and TT are practically the same and their origins are
related as $TT = TAI + 32.184$sec.

\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf Universal time} 
 
The universal time (UT) can be defined as the azimuth angle of 
the {\bf meridian(’»Ò’¸á’Àþ)} at Greenwich from
a straight line connecting the Sun and the center of the earth.
The origin of the angle is the direction to the earth
viewing from the Sun.
The angle is expressed in hour:minuit:second.
One complete rotation with respect to the Sun defines a day
$=$ 24 hours.
The length of a day in time depends on year and season of the measurement.
The origin of UT has therefore no absolute meaning in the time scales.

 UT may be identified by a local measurement provided the 
latitude and longitude of the location is known.
The value (UT0) is however depending on the location due to small fluctuation
of the rotation axis of the earth. The value corrected for the location
dependence is called {\bf UT1}.

{\bf UTC} (Coordinated Universal Time) counts time in the unit of SI second
and tuned so that $|\Delta UT = UT1 - UTC| < 0.9$ sec. To do this, an integral
number of seconds (leap seconds) are added to TAI at the last seconds of 
June and December. Thus $\Delta AT = TAI - UTC$ is always an integer seconds.
Values of $\Delta AT$ in recent years are \cite{ref:nasa},

\noindent
from 1996 01 Jul, UTC to 1997 01 Jul, UTC   $\Delta AT = +30$ sec  \newline
\noindent
from 1997 01 Jul, UTC to further notice     $\Delta AT = +31$ sec  
\begin{itemize}
\item No leap second will be introduced in UTC on 30 June 1998. \cite{ref:usno}
\item The Japanese standard time is given as $UTC + 9$hours.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf Greenwich mean sidereal time (GMST)} \newline
Sidereal time is the rotation angle of the earth around its axis
in a frame of reference fixed against the stars. The angle of the
meridian of Greenwich is measured
along the celestial equator to the direction of the earth rotation
from the mean equinox.

GMST at 0h UT on a date JD in Julian date is given as
\begin{equation}
 \mbox{GMST (sec)} = 2.411054841 \times 10^{4}
                + 8.640184812866 \times 10^{6}  T_{U}
                + 0.093104  T_{U}^2
                - 6.2 \times 10^{-6} T_{U}^3
\label{eqn:GMST}
\end{equation}
where
\[ T_{U} = (JD - 2451545.0) / 36525 \]
Julian date (JD) is the number of solar days from an origin. JD of
1998/Jan/01 0h UT is 2450814.5 JD and 2000/Jan/01 12h UT $=$ 
JD2451545.0.

To obtain a value of GMST (usually in hours) for a moment of time UT, 
first calculate GMST for 0h UT of the date. Add or subtract multiples of
24h as necessary.
Add then to the result 
UT of the moment $\times$ {\underline{1.00273790935}}
 if the moment is in the year 1998.
The number multiplied to UT is the length of one mean solar day 
in the unit of mean sidereal day in the year 1998.

An example is shown here. See on page B7 in \cite{ref:almanac}.
We calculate GMST for 1998/7/8 09:44:30 UT. First we find 
GMST(1998/7/8 0h UT) using Eq. (\ref{eqn:GMST}).
JD of the date at 0h is found from tables 
(\ref{table:daysinyear},\ref{table:daysinmonth})
that JD $= 2450814.5 + 181 + 7 = 2451002.5$. 
Eq. (eqn:GMST) gives 
\newpage
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lefteqn{\mbox{GMST(1998/7/8 0h UT)}} \\
  &=& 2.411054841 \times 10^{4} - 1.283312871 \times 10^{5}
         + 2.05394 \times 10^{-5} - 2.0 \times 10^{-11} \\
       &=& - 1.042207387 \times 10^{5} \; \mbox{seconds}
        = -28.95020519 \; \mbox{hours} \\
   &=& 19:02:59.2613 \; \mbox{(h:m:s)}
\end{eqnarray*}
The first line in the above eqations shows that the third and fourth
terms are negligible for the most purposes. From the second to third
line, we have added 48h to get a regular expression for time (angle).
The next step is to add the part of time passed from 0h UT to
09:44:30 UT. The sidereal time passed during this time span is
\[ 09:44:30 \;\mbox{UT} = 9.7417 \;\mbox{hours UT} 
        = 9.7683 \;\mbox{sidereal hours} \]
We thus obtain,
\[\mbox{GMST(1998/7/8 09:44:30 UT)} = 4.8181 \mbox{hours} = 04:49:05 \;.\]


\section{Coordinate System}
\noindent
{\bf The earth rotations}

  The earth is revolving around the Sun. This defines the ’¡Úecliptic 
(’²«’Æ»)’¡Ûcircle around the earth. The ecliptic circle is a circle centered at
the center of the earth and is on the plane of the revolution.
  The earth is rotating around its axis. The axis defines the direction north.
The polar angle of the axis with respect to the normal direction to the
revolution plane is called ’¡Úobliquity of the ecliptic (’²«’Æ»’Ê¿’¶Ñ’·¹’¼Ð’³Ñ)’¡Û and
given by ’¦Å= 23’¡ë26' 21''.488.  A plane parpendicular to the earth rotation
axis defines the ’¡Úcelestial equator(’Å·’¤Î’ÀÖ’Æ»)’¡Û. 
The angle between the celestial
equator and the ecliptic is the obliquity of the ecliptic.
  The direction of the revolution and the rotation are the same in a sense
that vectors of the revolution and rotation axes direct into the same
hemisphare. When one views the Sun-earth system from the north side
of the celestial sphare, the earth is revolving anti-clockwise
around the Sun and it rotates anti-clockwise around its axis.
  One of two points where the ecliptic and the celestial equator crosses  
is the ’¡Úvernal equinox(’½Õ’Ê¬’ÅÀ)’¡Û. A line from the Sun to the earth goes 
through this point on the equinox.

{\bf Low precision formulae for geocentric coordinates of the Moon}

The time argument $T_U$ is defined as
\[ T_U = (JD - 2451545.0) / 36525 \]
The universal time UT should be included in JD as a fraction of a day, namely,
JD $=$ JD(0h UT) + UT/24.
